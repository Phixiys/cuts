# **Welcome to Cuts... We shave your back!**

![Borat's got your back!](/src/assets/img/borat.jpeg)

### To shave your back you're gonna need to run
`yarn` (I prefer Yarn) 
or 
`npm install` 
in your terminal to install all the necesarry packages.

after that you need to run
`yarn dev` 
or 
`npm run dev` 
in your terminal to run the App locally.


## Best of luck and hope you have a smooth experience.
