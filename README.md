# ****Welcome to Cuts... We shave your back!**

![Borat's got your back!](/src/assets/img/borat.jpeg)

### To shave your back you're gonna need to run
`yarn` or `npm install` (I prefer Yarn) in your terminal

after that you need to run
`yarn dev` or `npm run dev` in your terminal to run the App locally.


## Best of luck and hope you have a smooth experience.
